## Installation

To use this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can create a virtual environment using `venv` to isolate the project dependencies. Here are the steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/divad437/Designs-Patterns`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd design-patterns-python`
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the project dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To run the tests and see examples of the design patterns in action, you can use `pytest`. Here are the steps to run the tests:

1. Make sure you have activated the virtual environment (see the installation steps above).
2. Run the tests: `pytest`

This will execute all the test cases and provide you with the results.

Feel free to explore the project and use the design patterns in your own code!
